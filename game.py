    Plays a game (defined by the env), where a model with MCTS action distribution improvement plays
    itself. Returns a tuple of (states, winner_vector, action_distributions)

    states, winner_vector, action_distributions are vectors of length equal to the number of turns played in the game.
    The winner vector is a vector of either the value 1, -1, or 0 for an eventual win, loss, or tie.
    Last state is not a vector, just a single state.

    ----------
    n_leaf_expansions: int
        number of leaves to expand in each iteration of MCTS when picking an action
    model: function
        Model to use for computing the value of each state,
        prob_vector, value = model(node.state, env)
    start_state:
        an initial game state (as defined by the environment)
    env:
        game playing environment that can progress game state and give us legal moves
    c_puct: float
        Constant that dictates how much score is assigned to exploring.
    temperature: int
        how much to explore low probability states
    max_num_turns: int
        maximum number of turns to play out before stopping the game
    verbose: boolean
